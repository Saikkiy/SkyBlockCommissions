# Hello all, this is Saikkiy with another SkyBlock mod for the community. This time I made a mining mod, as opposed to my recent flipper mods that you all have enjoyed using. It is a very simple mod that automates most tasks related to commissions and only requires the player to monitor it and provide it with the resources to thrive. As always any support on my Patreon is greatly appreciated and allows me to continue giving back to the community. Thanks and have a great day!
To use the mod just install it in your mods folder (%appdata% -> .minecraft folder -> .mods folder) then launch the game on Forge 1.8.9. (If your having a hard time with the mod not running it may be Skytils, as it has bugged the mod for some)
